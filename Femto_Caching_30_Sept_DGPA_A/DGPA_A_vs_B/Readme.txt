----- Functions -----

- DGPA_Single_Player

	Implements a single Learning Automaton that applies the principles of Discrete Generalized Pursuit Learning (DGPA). 

- DGPA_Single_Player_B

	Implementation of the newly designed DGPA algorithm based on Conditional Inaction (CI).


---- Scripts ---- 

- DGPA_Single_Player_Test

	A script that tests the ability of a single DGPA automaton to learn

- DGPA_Single_Player_A_vs_B_Challenge

	A script that compares the performance of the newly designed DGPA algorithm based on Conditional Inaction (CI) which is implemented in DGPA_Single_Player_B, with the performance of the standard DGPA implemented in DGPA_Single_Player.
