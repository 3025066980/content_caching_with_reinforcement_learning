-------------------------   DESCRIPTION   -------------------------

The algorithm implements a greedy caching strategy. It selects a random helper 
from the pool of available helpers and loops through all possible ways that
helper can cache M out of F files and picks the best one (the one that
minimizes the average latency that the users experience when requesting a 
file to that helper). It then goes on by selecting another helper at random
from the pool of remaning helpers until there are no more helpers left.
Random selections are always performed with unifrom probability mass
function. 

------------------------- INPUT PARAMETERS -------------------------

-- Network_Delays -- 
    The matrix of channel delays (H+1 columns, N rows)

-- M -- 
    Number of memory slots in each helper
       
-- Popularities --
    Array of file popularities.


------------------------- OUTPUT PARAMETERS -------------------------

-- Available_Files -- 
    The output of the caching problem, that is the files eventually cached
    by each helper.
    
-- helpers_avg_weighted_delay --
    the avg_weighted_delay for each helper after the optimization
